# Live Gesture Detection  

## Introduction  
Live Gesture Recognition is an application that captures and interprets human gestures as numbers. Gesture here, can refer to any physical movement, large or small of the fingers. This project has been built using OpenCV and Python. It is based on the concepts of object segmentation. It segments one foreground obeject which in this case is our hand, from a live video sequence.

## Working  

The two essential parts of this project are 
1. Segmentation of hand region from the video sequence
2. Count number of fingers from segmented region

### 1. Segmentation of the Hand Region





## Usage

## Future Scope  
This project can be extended to understand the gestures and execute commands based on the gestures.
